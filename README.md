This repository contains the backend service for a multi-tenant billing and inventory management system designed for retail stores.

The system supports barcode-based product scanning, real-time inventory tracking, store-level billing, and organization-level tenant isolation. It is built to scale across multiple stores and environments while ensuring secure data separation between tenants.

Core features include role-based access control, transaction-safe billing, inventory audit logs, and extensible APIs for reporting and analytics.
